# Generative AI for Requirements Engineering: A Scoping Literature Review

## Summary  
This study explores how Generative AI is applied in Requirements Engineering (RE), focusing on trends, challenges, and its role in optimizing the RE process. It assesses AI's impact on elicitation, refinement, and validation of requirements.

## Researchers  
- Jomar Thomas Almonte, Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng) Candidate, Penn State University 
- Dr. Nathalia Moraes do Nascimento, Assistant Professor, Penn State University 

## Research Questions  
1. **How is Generative AI applied in Requirements Engineering?**  
   - RE subdomains (e.g., elicitation, validation) addressed  
   - Specific Generative AI methods/tools used  
   - Frequency and venues of relevant studies  
   - Key contributing authors, institutions, or regions  

2. **What are the benefits and challenges of using Generative AI in RE?**  
   - Recurring evaluation themes  
   - Outcome comparisons across RE tasks  

3. **What research gaps exist in integrating Generative AI with RE?**  

## Databases Searched  
- **Engineering Village** (Compendex, Scopus, Inspec)  
- **IEEE Xplore**  

## Search Strategy  
```plaintext
(((((("Generative AI" OR "Large Language Models" OR "GPT" OR "GenAI" OR "LLMs")  AND ("Requirements Engineering" OR "software requirements" OR "requirements elicitation"  OR "requirements refinement" OR "requirements validation"))) WN ALL)) AND (({ca} OR {ja}) WN DT)) AND (({english} WN LA) AND ((2024 OR 2023) WN YR))) AND ({requirements engineering} WN CV))
```

### Search Strategy Notes  
The search targets Generative AI in RE while excluding broader software engineering terms. It retrieves only **conference and journal articles** (`{ca}` and `{ja}`) published in **English** (2023–2024), ensuring controlled vocabulary relevance (`WN CV`).

**Engineering Village (Compendex) yielded 95 results.**

## Review Process  
### Abstract Review  
- Independently review 100 articles for inclusion/exclusion  
- Calculate interrater reliability (target: 80%)  
- Discuss discrepancies and refine criteria  
- Screen remaining abstracts individually  

### Full-Text Review  
- Confirm inclusion criteria through full-text assessment  
- Proceed with data extraction for qualifying articles  

## Data Extraction Plan  
Extracted information includes:  
- Title, authors, publication year, and venue  
- Addressed RE subdomains  
- Generative AI tools/methodologies used  
- Evaluation metrics and methods  
- Benefits, challenges, and research gaps  

Guidelines for data extraction will be established and refined collaboratively.  

## Subgroup Analysis  
Focus areas:  
- Trends by RE subdomain (e.g., elicitation vs. validation)  
- AI methods/tools applied  
- Publication trends (journals vs. conferences)  
- Institutional and geographic patterns
